## Introduction

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write a 1-2 sentence summary of what data the pipeline is for and what it does -->

**adamrtalbot/containerregistry** is an example NF-Core pipeline including configuration switching the default container registry.

By default, it will use Docker containers stored on quay.io/biocontainers/ which are the default NF-Core containers. You can specify these using the docker container name, e.g. `multiqc:1.13--pyhdfd78af_0` which will resolve to `quay.io/biocontainers/multiqc:1.13--pyhdfd78af_0`. If you specify an alternative container registry such as `public.ecr.aws/biocontainers/` this will pull from an alternative registry, e.g. the previous example will resolve to `public.ecr.aws/biocontainers/multiqc:1.13--pyhdfd78af_0`. If you wish to use a different registry for an image, specify the entire registry in the module definition, e.g. `quay.io/biocontainers/python:3.8.3` in [samplesheet_check.nf](modules/local/samplesheet_check.nf). Finally, if you wish to override the default pipeline container image in the config it can be changed using module configuration. Check the Dockerhub container image specified for MultiQC in [conf/multiqc.config](conf/multiqc.config).

Important! The registry + image name should resolve. Biocontainers use a unique hash which may not match the existing container


Option 1: Run with default parameters which will pull all containers from quay.io:
`nextflow run main.nf -profile test,docker --outdir results`

Option 2: Run with an alternative base registry:
`nextflow run main.nf -profile test,docker --outdir results --registry 'public.ecr.aws/biocontainers/'`

Option 3: Run with a custom container for MultiQC:
`nextflow run main.nf -profile test,docker --outdir results -c conf/multiqc.config`

Option 4: Combine multiple to run from 3 different registries:
`nextflow run main.nf -profile test,docker --outdir results --registry 'public.ecr.aws/biocontainers/' -c conf/multiqc.config`

The rest of this repo is the default NF-Core 2.7.2 template.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.

## Pipeline summary

<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=22.10.1`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) (you can follow [this tutorial](https://singularity-tutorial.github.io/01-installation/)), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(you can use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) both to install Nextflow itself and also to manage software within pipelines. Please only use it within pipelines as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_.

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

   ```bash
   nextflow run adamrtalbot/containerregistry -profile test,YOURPROFILE --outdir <OUTDIR>
   ```

   Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

   > - The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker`, `singularity`, `podman`, `shifter`, `charliecloud` and `conda` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
   > - Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
   > - If you are using `singularity`, please use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
   > - If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

   <!-- TODO nf-core: Update the example "typical command" below used to run the pipeline -->

   ```bash
   nextflow run adamrtalbot/containerregistry --input samplesheet.csv --outdir <OUTDIR> --genome GRCh37 -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
   ```
